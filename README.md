# Minecraft Modpack

I've added some manually downloaded mods under `download`.

The server was also complaining about some other mods that made the current pack incompatible.

Added fabric-api `packwiz curseforge install https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files/6601119`.
Added monolib `packwiz curseforge install https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/monolib/files/6544054`.
Added trinkets `packwiz curseforge install https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trinkets/files/5173501`.
Added cloth-config `packwiz curseforge install https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config/files/5729105`.
